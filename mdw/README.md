# Most Distinctive Words (MDWs)

Revisiting the January 2015 attempt to identify unique words in the
2nd recension, this time using
[The Classical Language Toolkit] (http://cltk.org/) (CLTK).

merged.py represents the merger of the original unique.py with
test.py, the initial test of the CLTK toolkit. The original unique.py
removed stopwords from the MGH list; merged.py does't (yet).

The input files Gratian[12].txt contain only rubrics, apparently
(unconfirmed) only for Part I (the _Distinctiones_). This is only
for test, and the input files need to be replaced with the fixed
_dicta_ files.

There are no 'J', 'j', or 'v' characters in the input, but there
are initial 'V'characters.
